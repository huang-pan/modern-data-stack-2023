# Alternative LakeHouses

## Dremio
- Open source, unified data lakehouse solution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc6CCQpg1FA
	- 1 to 5 minute latency from data sources
	- has own semantic layer
	- product targeted towards existing enterprises with many data sources and complex data engineering
 		- can replace databricks, pinot, presto, etc.
   		- better than AWS Athena
- zero-etl solution: databases, snowflake, etc. accessible as data sources in lakehouse, no need to copy and move data

	- Snowflake as data source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa2xAfI8wNs
 	- Dremio Arctic: uses Iceberg's data versioning, ****data versioned as code**** (like Y42), auto optimization, data catalog
- has own SQL warehouse compute solution, cheaper than Snowflake?
	- Dremio Sonar: uses Apache Arrow (great for in-memory querying)   
- uses Apache Iceberg under the hood (superior to Delta Table, Parquet; has strong data versioning / data catalog, automated partitioning, time travel, ****partition versioning, schema evolution****, )
 	- Dremio data reflections replicates data from data sources into queryable Apache Iceberg files
