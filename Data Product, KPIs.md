	- Data product is an autonomous, read-optimized, standardized data unit containing at least one dataset (Domain Dataset), created for satisfying user needs
 	- Both internal and external data products
	- An internal data product is an application that uses data to make the next action immediate (e.g. a dashboard)
- https://moderndata101.substack.com/p/the-go-to-metrics-for-data-products
	- Product = customer x business x technology
	- customer metrics: customer lifetime value, # new users, DAU / MAU, retention rate, etc.
	- business metrics: directly generated revenue, costs / time saved
 	- market metrics: # new opportunities / listings per month, etc. and how it affects the business
	- tech metrics: cycle time, deployment frequency

	- A Data Product Canvas is a visual framework that guides your team through the data product specification. We suggest to fill out this canvas collaboratively. In total, the Data Product Canvas consists of ten building blocks:
	- Domain
	- Data Product Name
	- Consumer and Use Case
	- Output Port
	- Metadata
	- Input Ports
	- Data Product Design
	- Observability
	- Ubiquitous Language
	- Classification
- Understand business requirements for upcoming data ingestion work (Securities data, Master data, Positions data etc.)
	- Whatâ€™s the timeline to implement the pipeline?
	- What level of testing is required e.g., Source-to-Target reconciliation, Basic Data Quality vs Functional Testing)
	- What volume of data are we dealing with?
	- How will the data be consumed once it has been hosted in the Cloud Data Lake (AWS S3) and Warehouse (Snowflake)?
- Create a data pipeline spec that covers quality checks, assumptions, business metrics, and allows stakeholders to give feedback BEFORE you start coding
   	- stakeholders / end users / areas impacted
	- data
		- upstream / source
			- data contracts?
		- downstream
			- internal tools
			- external tools
			- KPIs / metrics
			- data science / ML
		- frequency
	- level of testing
	- implementation timeline
- Build data quality checks into your pipelines using data contracts such as write-audit-publish and write unit and integration tests to catch quality errors before they enter production
- Discover the power of data lake technologies Apache Iceberg. Proper schema evolution, partitioning, and parquet file format compression!
- Level up your SQL skills by having a four-hour crash course on GROUPING SETS, window functions, and cumulative table design

## KPIs
- Types of startup metrics

- Data team advice
	- https://youtube.com/watch?v=6HLo36SjOdo&si=ymtFT7JhkUukQ5sl
		- Focus on metric deltas between time periods,  cohorts
		- Attend non data team meetings,  e.g. marketing, revenue driving 
- 1st level metrics, 2nd level metrics

- Customer Lifetime Value = Average Revenue Per Customer / Churn Rate, Customer Acquisition Cost,
	- The CLV is the amount the customer spends every month (average revenue per customer, or ARPC for short) times the expected number of months they use our platform for. A clearer way of defining CLV is by dividing the ARPC by the churn rate (the percentage of users that stop using our platform each month)
