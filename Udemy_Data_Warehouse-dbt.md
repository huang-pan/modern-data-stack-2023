- Course completion certificate: [https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC\-9875515d\-9606\-4bfc\-8ddc\-e408d9d65aae/](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-9875515d-9606-4bfc-8ddc-e408d9d65aae/) 
- Summary:
    - This is a basic refresher course on data warehouses for me.
- warehouse / data lake
    - **Possible ways to structure a data warehouse like Snowflake**
        - Ultimately depends on company / project / use case
            - separate DBs for source, consumption, dev work?
            - think about boundaries, RBAC
        - Example:
            - one database per source, e.g. ATTOM\_DB, ZILLOW\_DB
                - RAW schema: data from source, aka dbt **src**
                    - can save historical data in dated tables
                        - time travel capabilities limited to finite time in Snowflake
                - BASE / STAGE schema: cleaned RAW data, aka dbt **stg**
                    - use views based off of RAW tables
            - ANALYST\_DEV\_DB, ANALYST\_PROD\_DB \(also TEST\_DB? only PROD\_DB gets exposed to BI tools used by end users.  can also name DB by analyst project\)
                - Dimensional Modeling
                    - INT schema: aka dbt **int**
                    - CORE schema:
                        - for dbt **fct**, **dim**
                            - by default, dbt seems to use dimensional modeling with fact / dimension tables, star and snowflake schemas
                        - for dbt **mart** 
                            - can also name schema by specific MART, e.g. marketing, biz dev, etc.
                            - can be wide tables for OBT architecture
                - One Big Table
                    - INT schema
                - Data Vault 2.0 \(Don't start with this on a greenfield project \- too much upfront complexity, only for enterprise data warehouses with 100s of sources of data \- data swamp\)
                    - RAW\_VAULT schema
                    - BUSINESS\_VAULT schema: \(optional\)
                - WRK schema: for dev work
            - DATASCIENCE\_DEV\_DB, DATASCIENCE\_PROD\_DB \(can also name them by Data Science or Machine Learning project\)
            - ADHOC\_DB: for one off work

            - Normalized modeling: Inmon copies directly from databases to data warehouse, also has data marts
            - Denormalized modeling: Kimball, dimensional modeling \(fact, dim, mart\), star, snowflake schemas, SCD
                - single source of truth for data source that maintains consistency, conformity, and understandability
                - dbt naturally supports dim modeling
                - good balance between normalized modeling and data vault 2.0

                - mainly for Enterprise Data Warehouses with a lot of different data sources, optimized for data ingestion, not reporting
                    - data supply driven
                        - complex to set up; time to get BI results slow in beginning

These tools are widely used in the industry and offer powerful features such as data modeling, profiling, and visualization.
            - Open\-source data modeling tools such as [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/?_gl=1*hdnksn*_ga*MTUzNzQ2NzYxNi4xNjg2NDMwODU5*_ga_HDBMVFQGBH*MTY4Nzc1MDQyNC4yLjAuMTY4Nzc1MDQyNC4wLjAuMA..) and [OpenModelSphere](http://www.modelsphere.com/) are free and offer essential features for creating data models. They are helpful for small projects and provide an opportunity for data engineers to learn data modeling skills.
            - Other tools are [Ellie.ai](https://www.ellie.ai/), whose key features are Data Product Design, Data Modeling, Business Glossary, Collaboration, Reusability, and Open API.
            - dbt can be seen as a transformation modeling tool. [Dagster](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/dagster/) can be used as a [DAG](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/dag-directed-acyclic-graph/) modeling tool. And so forth.

        - In working on this project, we established some conventions for naming our models.
        - **Sources** \(`src`\) refer to the raw table data that have been built in the warehouse through a loading process. \(We will cover configuring Sources in the Sources module\)
        - **Staging** \(`stg`\) refers to models that are built directly on top of sources. These have a one\-to\-one relationship with sources tables. These are used for very light transformations that shape the data into what you want it to be. These models are used to clean and standardize the data before transforming data downstream. Note: These are typically materialized as views.
            - can have persistent or non persistent data
        - **Intermediate** \(`int`\) refers to any models that exist between final fact and dimension tables. These should be built on staging models rather than directly on sources to leverage the data cleaning that was done in staging.
        - **Fact** \(`fct`\) refers to any data that represents something that occurred or is occurring. Examples include sessions, transactions, orders, stories, votes. These are typically skinny, long tables.
        - **Dimension** \(`dim`\) refers to data that represents a person, place or thing. Examples include customers, products, candidates, buildings, employees.

- 4 ETL patterns
    - append
    - in\-place update
    - complete replacement \(obsolete\)
    - rolling append \(delete older data\) \(obsolete\)
- stg clean data
    - raw \-\> stg; bronze \-\> silver; src \-\> stg
    - data value unification
    - data type unification
    - deduplication
    - drop columns
    - value based row filtering
    - error correction
- fact
    - additive fact \(e.g. salary\): store in fact table
    - non\-additive fact \(e.g. GPA\): store underlying components in fact tables
    - semi\-additive fact: used in periodic snapshot fact table
- star \(denormalized dimension tables\) vs snowflake \(normalized dimension tables\) schema
    - **only store lowest level PF\-FK relationship in fact table in snowflake schema**
    - ETL simpler for star schema
- keys
    - natural key: might be cryptic or understandable, travels from source systems with the rest of the data
        - keep natural keys in dimension tables in data warehouse, discard them in fact tables
    - surrogate key: no business meaning, generated by database
        - **use surrogate keys in data warehouse**
- dimensional tables
    - dimension = dimensional table
    - hierarchical \(college \-\> department \-\> faculty\) vs flat \(students\)
    - snowflake schema Primary Key \- Foreign Key rules
        - 1 table for each level of hierarchy
        - every non\-terminal dimension has: primary / surrogate key, the next\-highest level's PK/SK as a Foreign Key, can have multiple FKs
        - every terminal dimension has PK/SK, no FK
- fact tables
    - fact \!= fact table
    - **Primary Key of fact table is a combination of Foreign Keys to all dimensional tables**
    - **transaction: most common type of fact table**
        - store measurements from OLTP databases
        - add Surrogate Keys to Dimension Tables
        - can store facts that are available at same grain in same fact table, but facts have to occur simultaneously
        - PK of fact table: combination of all FKs of dimension tables
            - can store natural key in fact table
    - periodic snapshot
        - aggregated result of regular transactions
        - levels that are not related to regular transactions
    - accumulating snapshot
        - tracks elapsed time spent in each phase
            - can also track other related measures
        - **multiple relationships from fact table back to single dimension table**: e.g. date\_phase1\_key / date\_phase2\_key \-\> data\_dim
    - factless
        - record an event without a measurement
        - record existence of event / relationship or not
- slowly changing dimension \(obsolete with history tables?\)
    - techniques to manage history in data warehouse
    - type 1: no history retention
    - type 2: maintain unlimited history
        - create new dimension table row for each new version of history
            - create new Surrogate Key / Primary Key for new row in dim table
            - can create current\_flag column and / or effective\_date / expiration\_date columns to determine current \(not history\) row
        - most complex arch
    - type 3: maintain limited history
        - small number of dimension table columns for multiple versions of history
        - add new column rather than new row to reflect changes: old value vs new value column
        - best used for a dimension being reorganized, limited number of column categories \(\<= 4, \> 4 use type 2\)
    - less common:
        - type 0: always retain original value in the data warehouse
        - type 4: min\-dimension
        - type 5, 6, 7: hybrid
- ETL
    - use CDC to limit data ingest to warehouse
    - process dim tables before fact tables: create new dim table Surrogate Keys \-\> update fact table FKs
    - look for opportunities for parallel processing
- Case study dimensional modeling
	- https://youtube.com/watch?v=7HyGM3Iw0Kc&si=kX1FdNosFXzgXHba 
		- start with business problem --> find smallest grain --> create conceptual model --> create logical model
		- logical model: fact, dimension tables (who, what, when, how); each table: primary key, attributes
		- degenerate dimension ID: ID without any attributes (e.g. bar code), put in fact table, no dimension table

  	- Dim tables: Who What When How; Fact: measures
  		- https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/retailer-data-warehouse
- Fixing slow queries: If a query is running slowly or incurring high costs, I instinctively check for the following six factors. This approach typically resolves most issues related to query speed and cost.
	- 𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
		- Partitioning divides the data into smaller parts, and indexing helps the database retrieve data more quickly. Before executing your query, check if there is a partition or index you can use; this will significantly enhance your query's performance.
	- 𝟮. 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗪𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡’𝘀 Functions can prevent index usage. Instead, consider using calculated/generated columns with indexes.
	- 𝟯. 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻
		- Review the execution plan to identify any performance bottlenecks. Determine which operation is incurring high costs and explore ways to reduce the query's overall cost. Sometimes even though there is an index is present and the query intended to use it, query engine still might not use it. Maybe your index has corrupted? You can repair your index. You can even force query engine to use the index if it is still not using it.
	- 𝟰. 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: 𝗨𝗡𝗜𝗢𝗡 𝗗𝗜𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗧, 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘 %%, 𝗖𝗧𝗘’𝘀, 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀
		- Some statements are costly. Try to write queries without costly statements, use them as a last resort.
		- UNION DISTINCT compares the results of two sets and removes duplicates. If you are certain that the two result sets do not have duplicate rows, you can use UNION ALL, which is less computationally expensive.
		- The same principle applies to the 'LIKE' operator. Not only does it prevent index usage, but when used with both beginning and end wildcards, it becomes more computationally expensive. Try to avoid wildcard matching whenever possible.
		- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries cannot be indexed, so they can also be slow if they produce large results. Use them with caution.
	- 𝟱. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗪𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘, 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆
		- Optimize your queries by filtering your data early with the WHERE clause. This is one of the most fundamental yet occasionally overlooked query optimization techniques. If you don't require data from the previous year, make sure to filter it out.
	- 𝟲. 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗦𝗘𝗟𝗘𝗖𝗧 *
		- If you don’t need column do not select it. This rule holds significant importance, especially for columnar storage systems like BigQuery and Redshift, as they store and retrieve data based on columns rather than rows.

- Summary:
    - This is a refresher course on dbt for me. It covers all the basics with simple example, it's more like a tutorial introduction to dbt. While basic, I found this course to be a comprehensive re-introduction to dbt.
- Github repos for course:

dbt Core v1.5 is slated for release at the end of April, and it will include three new constructs:
- https://www.getdbt.com/blog/analytics-engineering-next-step-forwards/
- Access: Choose which models ought to be “private” (implementation details, handling complexity within one team or domain) and “public” (an intentional interface, shared with other teams). Other groups and projects can only ref a model — that is, take a critical dependency on it — in accordance with its access.
- Contracts: Define the structure of a model explicitly. If your model’s SQL doesn’t match the specified column names and data types, it will fail to build. Breaking changes (removing, renaming, retyping a column) will be caught during CI. On data platforms that support build-time constraints, ensure that columns are not null or pass custom checks while a model is being built, in addition to more flexible testing after.
- Versions: A single model can have multiple versioned definitions, with the same name for downstream reference. When a mature model with an enforced contract and public access needs to undergo a breaking change, rather than breaking downstream queriers immediately, facilitate their migration by bumping the version and communicating a deprecation window.
  
dbt bought Metricflow, dbt Core v1.6+
- https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/about-metricflow
    - logical models: current models
    - semantic models: KPI models
        - entities: ID
	    - dimensions: columns you aggregate / group by
	    - measures: columns you sum / avg, etc.
