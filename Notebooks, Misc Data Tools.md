## ETL / reverse ETL tools

Let’s start with obvious and super popular choices:
☑️ Airbyte Cloud – $100 per 10GB synced, consumption-based.
☑️ Stitch - $180 per month, consumption-based.
☑️ Fivetran wants $2.6K for 20M rows on a Starter plan. Consumption-based. Wow 🤯!
Now let’s look at the alternatives suggested to me:
☑️ DoubleCloud – about $140/month for 20M rows. Consumption-based.
☑️ Estuary – about $200 per month for 8GB of data. Consumption-based.
☑️ Portable - $290/month, one source, no volume limits. Commit.
☑️ Hevo – $400 per month for 20M rows. Commit.
☑️ Omnata – about $420/month, supposedly no rows limits. Commit.
☑️ Polytomic - starts from $500/month, no idea about limits. Commit.
☑️ Streamkap – $6K per year ($500/month) for 100M rows. Commit.
☑️ CDATA - $9K per year ($750 per month), 100M rows/month. Commit.
☑️ Matilion - $2K/month for 20M batch rows, $5.4K/month for 14M CDC rows. Commit with additional consumption-based credits.

    - If you are spending too much on Fivetran or frustrated with Airbyte, I believe Flow by Estuary offers best-in-class stability and simplicity while providing two advantages over the competition:
        1️⃣ Real time ingestion
        2️⃣ Lower cost of ownership
